kfilemetadata-kf5 (5.6.1-0ubuntu1) vivid; urgency=medium

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * Resolve transitional problems from lib2 to lib3 package with
    APT. Apt would refuse to upgrade the new (re-introduced) data
    package as it replaces and breaks the lib2 package and for some
    reason Apt considers the data package to be less useful, so it
    will hold lib2 and not upgrade which in turn results in the
    removal of plama-desktop & plasma-workspace as they need lib3.
    To prevent this problem also replicate the transition relationship
    onto the lib3 package (now breaks/replaces the lib2 package). This
    seems to give a sufficiently important package the breaks such
    that apt would choose to remove lib2 and install lib3.
    This transition is slightly unfortunate alltogether as it only
    ended up being so complicated by having data in the lib package
    to begin with.
  * Also soften the transitional relationship of the -data package.
    Originally it had use Conflicts where it should have used Breaks
    because files had simply moved about, there is no inherent conflict.
